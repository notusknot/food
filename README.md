# Food

Work in progress - a program that recommends you a weekly meal plan based on your needs

Roadmap/Todo:
> Sorted by estimated difficulty

- Filter based on more than one nutrient (should be pretty easy)
- Rewrite in Rust
- Implement breakfast/lunch/dinner/snack sorting (will take brute force work on database)
- Build web interface and compile Rust to WASM + integrate
- More micronutrient filtering options
- Filtering options based on health focus, condition, or diet (i.e. optimize for muscle gain, to help
with diabetes, vegetarian, etc)
- Content-based recommendation engine (requires database extension)
